# E666: Missing Explanation File

The explanation system allows for custom explanations to be associated with
codes. This can be done per-package, however it requires files providing
explanations to exist in a certain format. Like so:

```text
explanations
├── E001.md
├── E009.md
├── ...
└── E00x.md
```

When there is no file for a given code, a `ExplanationNotFound` error is raised.

This can result from the package author forgetting/mis-declaring the explanation
code.
