# E102: Inexact Error

An `InexactError` in Julia occurs when an operation results in a value that
cannot be represented exactly in the target type. This error often arises during
type conversions where the destination type cannot accurately represent the
value being assigned, and is often fixed by adjusting the type or rounding.

# Common Scenarios Leading to `InexactError`

**Type Conversion Issues**: This is the most common cause. For instance, attempting to convert a floating-point number to an integer will trigger an `InexactError` if the floating-point number has a fractional part, as integers cannot represent fractions.

```julia
x = 3.5
y = Int(x)  # This will raise an InexactError
```

**Range Violations**: When converting between types of different ranges, an `InexactError` can occur if the value is out of the range of the target type. For example, converting a large `Int64` value to an `Int8` might exceed the storage capacity of `Int8` .

```julia
large_int = 300
small_int = Int8(large_int)  # This will raise an InexactError
```
 
**Loss of Precision** : Some conversions, like from a higher precision floating-point number to a lower precision type, can also result in this error if the value cannot be represented accurately.

```julia
big_float = 1.234567890123456789
smaller_float = Float32(big_float)  # This may raise an InexactError depending on the value
```
 
# Fixing an `InexactError`

**Rounding**: If the error is due to fractional parts in floating-point to integer conversion, using rounding functions like `round`, `floor`, or `ceil` before conversion can resolve the issue.

```julia
x = 3.5
y = Int(round(x))  # This converts 3.5 to 4 and avoids InexactError
```

**Checking Value Ranges** : Ensure that values being converted are within the valid range of the target type. Adding explicit checks before conversion can prevent the error.

```julia
large_int = 300
if large_int <= typemax(Int8) && large_int >= typemin(Int8)
    small_int = Int8(large_int)
else
    println("Value out of range for Int8")
end
```

 **Using Appropriate Types** : Sometimes, the error suggests that the chosen type is not suitable for the value range. Opting for a type with a larger range or precision can be a solution.

```julia
x = 3.5
y = Int(x)  # This raises an InexactError
z = trunc(Int, x)  # This will truncate the value to 3, avoiding the error
```
