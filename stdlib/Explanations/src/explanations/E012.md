# E12: String concatenation uses multiplication not addition

While `*` may seem like a surprising choice to users of languages that provide `+` for string
concatenation, this use of `*` has precedent in mathematics, particularly in abstract algebra.

In mathematics, `+` usually denotes a *commutative* operation, where the order of the operands does
not matter. An example of this is matrix addition, where `A + B == B + A` for any matrices `A` and `B`
that have the same shape. In contrast, `*` typically denotes a *noncommutative* operation, where the
order of the operands *does* matter. An example of this is matrix multiplication, where in general
`A * B != B * A`. As with matrix multiplication, string concatenation is noncommutative:
`greet * whom != whom * greet`. As such, `*` is a more natural choice for an infix string concatenation
operator, consistent with common mathematical use.

More precisely, the set of all finite-length strings *S* together with the string concatenation operator
`*` forms a [free monoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_monoid) (*S*, `*`). The identity element
of this set is the empty string, `""`. Whenever a free monoid is not commutative, the operation is
typically represented as `\cdot`, `*`, or a similar symbol, rather than `+`, which as stated usually
implies commutativity.

## Examples

```julia
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 * " " * str2  # "Hello World"

# Concatenating multiple strings
greeting = "Hi"
name = "Alice"
punctuation = "!"
message = greeting * ", " * name * punctuation  # "Hi, Alice!"
```
